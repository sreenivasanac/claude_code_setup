# Prompt Refiner

## Instructions

When the user wants to refine a prompt:

1. Ask for their draft prompt or task description
2. Analyze it for:
   - Clarity: Is the goal specific and measurable?
   - Context: Does it include relevant background?
   - Constraints: Are requirements and limitations stated?
   - Examples: Would examples help clarify expectations?
3. Suggest an improved version with explanations
4. Offer to iterate if needed

## Good Prompt Patterns

- Start with the outcome: "Create a..." not "I want you to..."
- Include acceptance criteria: "The result should..."
- Specify format: "Return as JSON/markdown/code"
- Mention constraints: "Must be compatible with...", "Should not modify..."
