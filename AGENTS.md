# Agent Instructions

## Rules & Memories
- Follow personal rules in `~/.factory/rules/`:
  - `~/.factory/rules/tools.md`
  - `~/.factory/rules/workflow.md`
  - `~/.factory/rules/package-managers.md`
  - `~/.factory/rules/repo-boundaries.md`
- Refer to `~/.factory/memories.md` for non-prescriptive preferences, references, and past decisions.

## Notes
- Keep `~/.factory/AGENTS.md` lightweight; put prescriptive standards in `~/.factory/rules/` and non-prescriptive references/decisions in `~/.factory/memories.md`.
